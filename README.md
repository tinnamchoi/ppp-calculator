[Purchasing Power Parity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purchasing_power_parity) (PPP) is a way to compare how much money can buy in different countries. Taking in factors such as cost of living, it provides a more nuanced view into the value that your money has in the country, rather than naively doing a currency exchange.

Example: Due to the lower cost of living in Hong Kong, 50000.00 in Hong Kong has the same purchasing power as 12526.04 in Australia in their respective local currencies, despite being equivalent to AUD9,317.70 according to currency exchanges. (updated as of 2024 Sep 27)
